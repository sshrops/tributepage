    <h2 id="tribute-title"> A brief summary of Oda-san and his most legendary title.</h2>
    <p><span style="color:#e60000"> Eiichiro</span> Oda was born on January 1, 1975 in Kumamato City, <span style="color:#e60000">Japan</span>. At a young age Oda-san was inspired to become a manga artist by his love of <span style="color:#e60000">manga</span> and tv as well as a desire to avoid a boring everyday job. His biggest <span style="color:#e60000">influences</span> of his early years revolved around the popular <span style="color:#e60000">Dragon Ball</span> Franchise as well as his favorite show Vicky the Viking. When he eventually turned 17, Oda-san submitted an original work titled <span style="color:#e60000">Wanted!</span> To Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. This title won several awards and eventually <span style="color:#e60000">landed</span> him a job at the same publication. A few years later in <span style="color:#e60000">1997</span>, Oda-san released One Piece. This new series would go on to become the most <span style="color:#e60000">popular</span> manga of all time. Since its debut Oda-san has won countless <span style="color:#e60000">awards</span> and praise for his manga and its anime adaptation.  In 2010 One piece would become the first manga to ever be featured in the famous <span style="color:#e60000">Japanese</span> menís fashion magazine Non-no mag. Later in 2015 the Gummies Book of World Records awarded One piece the record for most copies published of the same comic book series. <span style="color:#e60000">One piece</span> is currently still ongoing as of 2018 and shows no signs of slowing down in the near future. It has eclipsed its humble beginnings as just a manga and has become a <span style="color:#e60000">phenomenon</span> in japan and among many fans located all over the world. </p>
